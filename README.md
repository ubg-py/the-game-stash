a WHOLE LOT of free and open-source games for anyone to take!


I have never really done anything on GitHub besides look at some code in some files in some random repositories, so I don't know exactly how this is going to turn out. I am mainly making this for my friends, but I am also making this for everyone to use and have fun with! If anyone can give me any tips or something, please do!

Go to the *credits.txt* file to see where I got all of these games, and where you can get these games for yourself!
